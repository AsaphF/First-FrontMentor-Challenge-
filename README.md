# First-FrontMentor-Challenge-
 Card Product Component


This, is the first project that i am doing from the Frontend Mentor website. Below there's  a list of things that were interesting to me while i was doing this project.

1 - The css pseudo-element ":after" that can be use to improve the content of a element.
2 - The usage of google fonts.
3 - The usage of display "flex" trough out the whole project.
