# FrontMentor-Challenge-
 - Card Product Component


This, is the first project that i am doing from the Frontend Mentor website. Below there's  a list of things that were interesting to me while i was doing this project.

 a - The css pseudo-element ":after" that can be use to improve the content of a element.
 b - The usage of google fonts.
 c - The usage of display "flex" trough out the whole project.
